            <h3>Vinyl makes you step back in time</h3>
            <p>
              Vinyl is a unique and subjectively the best way to listen to
              music. Espically music recorded in mono. All recordings were
              recorded in mono until stereo was introcuded as an innovative
              recording technology in 1958. To listen to a mono record of music
              orgiginally released in mono gives you the opportunity to hear how
              everone heard this music for the first time. Any record has a
              particular richness to the sound that a CD or streaming service
              simply can not replicate. It gives the music texture, warmth, and
              depth that is one of a kind.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Bill Meehan. I'm a singer songwriter and a record
              collector. I wrote my first song when I was 15 years old and have
              continued decorating silence with my guiatr and voice for 51
              years.
